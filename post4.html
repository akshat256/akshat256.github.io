		<h3>International Debt Analysis</h3>

		<p>It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. 
            For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives.
		<br>
		<br>
		In this Project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount
         of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:
		<br>
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?</li>
            <li>Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?</li>
            <li>What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?</li>
        </ul>
		</p>
        
	
		<p>
        In this notebook, I took a look at debt owed by countries across the globe. I also extracted a few summary statistics 
        from the data and unraveled some interesting facts and figures. I also validated my findings to make sure the investigations were correct.
        </p>
