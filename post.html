		<h3>Face Mask Detection</h3>

		<p>I worked on real time face mask detection app,The primary goal of the project was to contribute to public health and safety by
			 leveraging computer vision and deep learning technologies.
		<br>
		<br>
		The face mask detection app was developed using Python and computer vision techniques. The core of the app relied on the MobileNetV2 model, 
		which was enhanced with additional layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flattening, 2D, Dense, and Dropout. This architecture was designed to
		 improve the accuracy of detecting whether a person in an image or video frame was wearing a mask.
		<br>
		<br>
		To train the model, a small dataset consisting of images of both masked and unmasked faces was used. To augment this dataset and make it 
		more robust, various data augmentation techniques were employed. This step was crucial for ensuring that the model could generalize well to 
		different scenarios and variations in mask-wearing appearances.
		<br>
		<br>
		For the live detection feature, the app utilized the imutils library to capture live video. The process involved first detecting faces in the 
		video stream using a prebuilt face detection model. Once a face was detected, the frame containing the face was passed through the custom CNN
		 model to predict whether the face was wearing a mask or not.
		<br>
		<br>
		This combination of techniques allowed for real-time detection of mask-wearing behavior, which could be 
		valuable in various settings such as public spaces or workplaces.</p>
